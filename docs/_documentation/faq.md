### I don't see any changes in development mode

This likely because a plugin is caching your assets. In Google Chrome you can
toggle the _Update on reload_ setting in the _Applications_ tab of the Developer
Tools, this should fix most of your caching issues while developing your app. If
the problem persists, you should file a bug report with the plugin that is
causing the problem.
